* Us a more compact style

It looks like you either have a very strong policy on style and
layout, or used an auto-formatter, because in some places, `SELECT *`
is written in two lines.  That is good, because the query is at least
well formatted and readable.  If you want it to be more compact,
though, you might want to skimp a bit on the newlines.

When formatting code more compactly, there is still "breathing space",
but the scroll-factor is tuned down a bit, so you have a bit higher
view of the code.  I find that it can help.

I like to use a combination of indentation to recognize the query
parts (my indentation is by no means the default in SQL) and a thing I
call "one concept per line", where each line tells me something that
can stand on its own for logic.

Not indenting `UNION`s helps to see the "equal level" of both sides of
the `UNION`, and prevents the lines from getting too long.

There is still some compactness to be gained if you write `JOIN`s with
just one `ON` clause on a single line, but only when that `JOIN` is
trivial (for instance on matching primary keys).  Especially in the
final part, I find the symmetry of the `JOIN`s to be clear.

* Use `LEFT JOIN` and `COALESCE` for edge cases

   Four times you add a `UNION` on a subquery to account for an edge
   case.  Three of those are when you want to split on `@MaxLen`,
   because there is no shorter match.  But there is another way to do
   that.

   In SQL, missing data is represented as a `NULL` value.  When we use
   an `INNER JOIN`, those `NULL`s disappear, because we can only join
   on data that we know.  Adding missing data afterwards through a
   `UNION` and a back reference (querying the same data but asking
   where it is missing) is possible.  But we can also just take those
   `NULL`s with an `OUTER JOIN` (mostly `LEFT` or `RIGHT`), and tell
   SQL to replace missing values by something else, using [[https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms190349.aspx][`COALESCE`]].

** In the Chunk CTEs

    In the FirstChunk, we only know that something is missing if we know
    of all the organisations, so we need to select the data from the
    origin as well:

  #+BEGIN_SRC sql
         , FirstChunk AS
         ( SELECT O.OrganisationID
                , 1 AS ChunkStart
                , COALESCE(MAX(D.Position), @MaxLen) AS ChunkEnd
             FROM dbo.Organisations O
             LEFT JOIN ( SELECT S.OrganisationID
                              , S.Position + 1 AS Position
                           FROM SplitPositions S
                          WHERE Position BETWEEN 1 AND @MaxLen
                       ) D ON D.OrganisationID = O.OrganisationID
              GROUP BY O.OrganisationID
         )
  #+END_SRC

    Notice that we don't select `D.OrganisationID` for the first column
    any more, because that can also be `NULL` if we can't split.  That
    also means that we need to `GROUP BY` the newly selected value.

    In the other two CTEs, we can just take the existing values of the
    previous CTEs:

  #+BEGIN_SRC sql
         , SecondChunk AS
         ( SELECT C.OrganisationID
                , C.ChunkEnd + 1 AS ChunkStart
                , COALESCE(MAX(D.Position), C.ChunkEnd + @MaxLen) AS ChunkEnd
             FROM FirstChunk C
             LEFT JOIN ( SELECT S.OrganisationID
                              , S.Position + 1 AS Position
                           FROM SplitPositions S
                          INNER JOIN FirstChunk C ON C.OrganisationID = S.OrganisationID
                          WHERE S.Position BETWEEN C.ChunkEnd + 1 AND C.ChunkEnd + @MaxLen
                       ) D ON D.OrganisationID = C.OrganisationID
            GROUP BY C.OrganisationID, C.ChunkEnd
         )
         , ThirdChunk AS
         ( SELECT C.OrganisationID
                , C.ChunkEnd + 1 AS ChunkStart
                , COALESCE(MAX(D.Position), C.ChunkEnd + @MaxLen) AS ChunkEnd
             FROM SecondChunk C
             LEFT JOIN ( SELECT S.OrganisationID
                              , S.Position + 1 AS Position
                           FROM SplitPositions S
                          INNER JOIN SecondChunk C ON C.OrganisationID = S.OrganisationID
                          WHERE S.Position BETWEEN C.ChunkEnd + 1 AND C.ChunkEnd + @MaxLen
                       ) D ON D.OrganisationID = C.OrganisationID
            GROUP BY C.OrganisationID, C.ChunkEnd
         )
  #+END_SRC

  Now the query is more compact, but also faster, because we add the
  edge cases in the same "swoop".
